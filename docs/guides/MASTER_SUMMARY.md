## 🎓 Why This Order?

### Todo 1-3: Critical Foundation (180 hours - 8 weeks)
**Why First?**
- Events is blocking - can't build interactive features without it
- Testing improves code quality immediately
- Test suite expansion is quick wins
- Combination reaches 75% completion
- **Impact**: Transforms from "beginner resource" to "intermediate resource"

### Todo 4-5: Real-World Skills (130 hours - 6-7 weeks)
**Why Second?**
- APIs and Security are non-negotiable for real apps
- Completes essential JavaScript knowledge
- Reaches "production-ready" status (85%)
- Foundation for advanced topics
- **Impact**: Makes platform job/interview relevant

### Todo 6-7: Specialized Topics (165 hours - 8-9 weeks)
**Why Third?**
- Algorithms and Canvas are specialized
- Can start after core is solid
- Don't block other development
- Add significant value but not critical
- **Impact**: Makes platform "comprehensive"

### Quality Items: Parallel
**Why Concurrent?**
- JSDoc can be added incrementally
- Accessibility improvements don't wait
- Mobile optimization iterative
- Don't block main development
- **Impact**: Continuous quality improvement
