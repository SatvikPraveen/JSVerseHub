## 📞 Questions & Answers

### Q: Is JSVerseHub ready to launch?
**A**: 60% ready. Core concepts are solid, but 6 important concepts are missing. Add those + tests + polish = launch ready.

### Q: How much work is left?
**A**: 210-265 hours to reach 95% completion (production ready).

### Q: Can I launch now?
**A**: Yes, but only for beginners. Missing Events, Security, Testing, APIs prevents intermediate+ learners from full benefit.

### Q: What's the hardest part?
**A**: Implementing Algorithms & Canvas (highly technical). Events & Testing are well-defined and easier to execute.

### Q: Can this be monetized?
**A**: Yes, multiple paths (freemium, B2B licensing, certifications, sponsorships).

### Q: Is the code maintainable?
**A**: Yes, excellent architecture with clear patterns and good documentation.
